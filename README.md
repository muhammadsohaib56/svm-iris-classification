# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using SVM

This project uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** — a powerful supervised learning algorithm — to classify flowers from the classic **Iris dataset**. It applies data visualization and SVM modeling to demonstrate effective multiclass classification.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most popular datasets in pattern recognition. It includes 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

- `sepal length (cm)`
- `sepal width (cm)`
- `petal length (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`
- `target`: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, or Iris Virginica

---

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svm-iris-classification.git
   cd svm-iris-classification
````

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SVM-iris.ipynb
   ```

3. (Optional) Convert to script:

   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to script SVM-iris.ipynb
   ```

---

## 🧠 Model Used

* **SVM (Support Vector Classifier)** from `sklearn.svm.SVC`
* Trained using features from the Iris dataset
* Hyperparameters like kernel type (e.g., linear, RBF) may be tuned
* Multiclass classification using One-vs-One strategy

---

## 🎯 Project Highlights

* 📈 Data loading and visualization
* 🧹 Preprocessing if needed (label encoding, splitting)
* 🤖 SVM model training and prediction
* 📊 Visualization of decision boundaries (if implemented)

---

## ✅ Results

* High accuracy in classifying all three iris flower species
* Shows the power of SVM in handling multiclass classification
